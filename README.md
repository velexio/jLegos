Java Legos (jLegos) - Is a collection of common code used when building application at Velexio for Java projects
We are publishing them as a way to give back to the Open Source community since we have enjoyed so many contributions
ourselves.

We are in the early phases of this project, so consider this Beta for nwo and we will update in a progressive manner until it 
is considered a stable artifact to be used you other projects.
